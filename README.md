# Cat Animation

This animated cat is inspired by [the purrfect guide for creating an animated cat](https://www.svgator.com/blog/how-to-create-an-animated-cat/) by [svgator](https://youtube.com/@SVGator). The animated cat was originally created using SVG, but this animation is created using HTML and CSS only. 

You can view the animation in [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/Abdullah1tani/pen/mdzGjwq) or clone the GitHub repository with this link: https://github.com/Abdullah1tani/cat-animation.git
